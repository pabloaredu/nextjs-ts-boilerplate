# Atolio Front End Challenge

## What is an intrepid Hitchhiker without a Guide?

As we stumble though life and travel the winding by-ways of far flung planets, it is often required to have some sort of guide... a book, or in our case a small application.

Your task is to take these sample quotes and build an interactive, electronic book. As with all reliable guide books we will need the ability to bookmark and retrieve quotes for later use. Reading in advance about that perfect little bar or drink to be avoided at all costs is fine and good, but you do need to return to the correct passage as you find yourself seated at the table.

You can use any framework you choose to build the actual application. A simple Express server is provided to create a search API and this too can be changed in any way that will help you. You will find it located in the server directory. You can use the provided `npm start` task to run the API server. Feel free to leave it unchanged, rebuild, or replace it to best suit your needs.

You should be able search for passages using simple keywords like 'towel', '42', or 'the answer'. Once you have found the desired passage, add a button to save it to your quotes and a link to show all saved quotes. While not strictly required, it would be nice to reload the page and continue to show the saved quotes.

Ideally, reloading the search page should show the same search results. Again, while this is not strictly required, editors of The Guide are not the most reliable and often need to reload their work.

Quotes from either the saved quotes or search page should link to a page showing just that quote, letting us save and share links. How the URL is constructed is up to you, but each quote should get a unique identifier.

As with all things in life ("Life! Don't talk to me about Life"), it is not the end state but the journey. We will go over you final code together and evualate how and why you got where you did.
